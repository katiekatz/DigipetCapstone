# DigipetCapstone
## By Emma Ingallinera, Nicholas Kassoy, Kaitlyn Katz, and Timothy Obiso
### Created as a year-long Capstone Project at Bergen County Academies
Goal: to create a language-learning app that integrated multiple languages, with a focus on pronunciation and a main purpose of reinforcing lessons learned in a classroom environment.
Outcome: although time constraints limited the actual number of lessons and games implemented, the group was able to complete the entire layout of the app, including all main pages and lesson/game lists, as well as create a few examples of both lessons and games. The app has lots of room for expansion with more lessons, games, and languages.
